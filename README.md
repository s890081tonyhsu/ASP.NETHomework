ASP.NET Homework for Class Project
====

This is only the homework which I need to backup on github.

It won't contain any privacy data when build it or run it but not concerned in the future.

I'll trying to follow the teacher's ~~weird~~ instruction to complete the class.

Some Images I use are for testing or self using. If I have time, I'll make a list below.

Maybe the project will be special or normal in the future, so I'll hope it's a good class after I finish it.
