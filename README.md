ASP.NET Homework for Class Project
====

This is only the homework which I need to backup on github.

It won't contain any privacy data when build it or run it but not concerned in the future.

I'll trying to follow the teacher's ~~weird~~ instruction to complete the class.

Some Images I use are for testing or self using. If I have time, I'll make a list below.

Maybe the project will be special or normal in the future, so I'll hope it's a good class after I finish it.

DataBase Seting
----

After clone to the new place, you need to settle up the following tables in "Web1c" database for your database server.

```
	./Web1c/App_Data/dbo.Table.sql // for account and password
	./Web1c/App_Data/dbo.Drink.sql // for drink names and price
	./Web1c/App_Data/dbo.Order.sql // for ordering the drinks

Point the port at 9601 by following instruction below the link.
